## TLG Capstone T1

The GUI version of this game was created from the existing code base of the original text based, console game. As a team, we created what is now the current view structure when the game is played with the GUI. Much of the game logic has remained the same or was expanded on from the original with the main difference being it is implemented with an interface that allows the user to interact with the game through a different lens. Much was learned through this process, as most of us had little knowledge utilizing Java Swing but ultimately had a lot of fun doing it! We hope you enjoy the game as much as we did building it.

## The Story

A temple in remote location, but it's actually an Alien ship. They’re trying to contact their home-world, so they can invade Earth. A Major Government power is looking to Nuke the whole area because **“It’s the only way to be sure”** they don’t contact their home-world. You are a part of a special ops team that has intel that states even if the site is nuked, the signal will still be sent. Your mission (and you already chose to accept it) is to infiltrate the temple and find a means to disable the communication device and get out before the nuke drops. You will be dropped to the south of the temple nearby. Your ex-filtration route will be back the way you came in. Ensure you get back to the pickup with enough time for us to pick you up. If you miss the window, we will not be able to safely extract you.

#### Game Flow

Navigate a maze, overcome obstacles, gather items and reach the aliens communications room under a maximum number of moves.
Multiple endings to the game such as a full win, total loss or win with death.

#### GUI

Navigation arrows to maneuver around the map. Buttons to the bottom left for different actions. Location indicator and health bar at the top of the HUD. Help button for game info. File dropdown menu for general game actions such as setting and quit game.
